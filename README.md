# machine-learning-project

For this project we've decided to do a study on the House Prices dataset found in Kaggle (link at the end), a data set for a contest with 79 columns and around 2000 examples of houses sold and their prices based on different information like the size, the distance between the house and the street, the quality of the pool (if there is one), among others. The objective of the project is to analyze this data set by applying statystical tests in order to discover the relationship between the provided features as well as applying different Machine Learning algorithms on the data set in order to compare their performance, this would include both supervised and unsupervised learning methods as well as different preprocessing steps on the data before applying the algorithms with the objective of showing the effect that these steps have in the learning process. 

At the moment of this writing the competition is still active, but there are already contestants with squared error of 0.00, ideally we would like to obtain the lowest squared error possible and upload our results to the competition to compare our results with others in the leaderboard.
