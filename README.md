# machine-learning-project

For this project we've decided to do a study on the Lending Club Loan dataset found in Kaggle (link at the end), a data set with 75 columns and 887383 examples of all loans issued through 2007-2015 with information like loan status, latest payment information, credit scores, number of finance inquiries and address among others. The objective of the project is to analyze this data set by applying statystical tests in order to discover the relationship between the provided features as well as applying different Machine Learning algorithms on the data set in order to compare their performance, this would include both supervised and unsupervised learning methods as well as different preprocessing steps on the data before applying the algorithms with the objective of showing the effect that these steps have in the learning process.
